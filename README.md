Puzzle Crawler

A small dungeon crawler with RPG elements and potential physics puzzle problems. 
We started off with practically no knowledge of game engines or scripting languages like Lua, or animation, or creating art, etc. But in ~30 hours we gained experience with Project Anarchy and Lua scripting, probably much quicker than we would've without the help of the experts, and this immersion was super helpful with encourging learning.
